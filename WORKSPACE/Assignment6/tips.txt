Here is the process for plotting:Phase 1: Getting a matrix with unscaled X1 and X2	1	Generate X1 and X2 via np.meshgrid	2	Shape X1 and X2 into a two-column matrix	3	Use the existing Polynomial Features to transform the resulting matrix from the above step. The purpose of this step is only for getting a required matrix shape to feed the existing Standard Scaler.	4	Use the existing Standard Scaler to inverse transform the resulting matrix from the above step.	5	Extract the first two columns from the resulting matrix from the above step. Phase 2: Getting a matrix with scaled(X1), scaled(X2), scaled(X1^2), scaled(X2^2), and scaled(X1*X2)	6	Use the existing Polynomial Features again to transform the resulting matrix from above step. This step will generate a matrix in which every column is useful.	7	Use the existing Standard Scaler again to transform the resulting matrix from the above step. Let’s say the resulting matrix from this step is called X_grid. Phase 3: Plotting	8	plt.contourf(X1, X2, classifier.predict(X_grid).reshape(X1.shape),alpha = 0.75, стар = ListedColormap(l'red', 'green']))
